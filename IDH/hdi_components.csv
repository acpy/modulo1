Human Development Report 2011 - Sustainability and Equity: A Better Future for All
Table 1 - Human Development Index and its components

HDI = Human Development Index: A composite index measuring average achievement in three basic dimensions of human developmentâa long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. See Technical note 1 for details on how the HDI is calculated.

life_exp = Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth stay the same throughout the infantâs life.

edu_yrs = Mean years of schooling: Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from education attainment levels using official durations of each level.

edu_yrs_exp = Expected years of schooling: Number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the childâs life.

gni_pc = Gross national income per capita: Aggregate income of an economy generated by its production and its ownership of factors of production, less the incomes paid for the use of factors of production owned by the rest of the world, converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) rates, divided by midyear population.

gni_pc_min_hdi = GNI per capita rank minus HDI rank: Difference in rankings by GNI per capita and by the HDI. A negative value means that the country is better ranked by GNI than by the HDI.

hdi_non_gni = Nonincome HDI: Value of the HDI computed from the life expectancy and education indicators only.
